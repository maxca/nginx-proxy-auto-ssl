![Opensea whitelabel website template](opensea-whitelabel-website-template.jpg?raw=true "Opensea whitelabel website template")

This is a Scaffold for an opensea marketplace using opensea-js. Based on a NextJS scaffold by [Tajo](https://github.com/tajo/nextjs-baseweb).

The main goal of this project is to create a template based on baseui that any artists can use to create, display and sell their NFTS on their own website with an added layer of customization.

The current implementation is a simple marketplace for an artist to sell their NFTs they created on the [Opensea](https://opensea.io) marketplace.
